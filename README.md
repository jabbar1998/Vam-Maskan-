# Bank Checker with Selenium

This application is designed to check a specific website to determine whether a bank service is open or closed. Built using Selenium, it automates interactions with the website and verifies the availability of a particular bank.

---

## Features

- Automates navigation and interactions with the target website.
- Logs into the website using a phone number and OTP.
- Checks for specific text or elements to identify the status of the bank.
- Handles dynamic page content and retries actions in case of errors.

1. **Python** (Version 3.8 or higher)
2. **Google Chrome** (Latest stable version)
3. **ChromeDriver** (Compatible with your Chrome version)

## Usage
